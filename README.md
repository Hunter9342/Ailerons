# Predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft using various MachineLearning Regression Techniques.

## Ailerons EDA & Comparison of different Regression models.ipynb consists:
1.EDA and Statistical analysis of data.

2.ML Regression models trained on Normalized data and also Un-Normalized data and are compared.

3.Linear Regression, Lasso Regressor, Elastic Net Regressor, RandomForest Regressor are built and compared.

4.RandomForest Regressor has 83% Accuracy, Linear Regression with Correlation Feature Selection got 81% Accuracy.

5.Loss Funtion used is "RMS"
